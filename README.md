# CPP-first-steps
Solving a few basic problems in an attempt to learn some rudimentary elements of C++ 

3 tasks:

#1. fizzbuzz function: Print the natural numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusive), replacing 
numbers divisible by 3 with "Fizz" and numbers divisible by 5 with "Buzz". Numbers divisible
by both 3 and 5 should be replaced with "FizzBuzz". Output the result with each entry 
separated by a comma and a space (no comma after 100).

Example output for integers in the range [1, 15]:

1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz

#2. palindrome function: Using pointers, check if a string is a palindrome. Ignore all whitespace, 
punctuation, and capitalization.

Examples: civic, noon, racecar, "step on no pets", "Was it a cat I saw?"

#3. egg function: You have two eggs, which are identical and interchangeable. you goal is
to see how durable these eggs are by dropping them off a 100-story building without breaking. 

Both eggs will break when dropped from floor n. You can assume that if an egg breaks at 
some floor k, that egg will break at any floor higher up in the building; else, if the 
egg does not break when dropped from floor n, that egg will not break when dropped from any 
lower floor. 

Determine the fewest number of times to drop the eggs to locate floor n. When setting up
this problem: randomly assign some floor n between 1 and 100.
